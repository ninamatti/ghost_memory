# ghost_memory

A memory game inspired by one of my favourite games of 2020, Ghost of Tsushima. Built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

### Features

- Counter: Each game has a counter that will start at 100 and count down to 0. If win condition isn't reached until that time, the game is lost.
- Matching mechanism: When a card is selected, it is turned by 180 degrees and flipped to its front. It will stay this way until a second card is flipped. If the cards match, both cards will stay visible. If not, both cards will be flipped to their back again.
- Music and sound: music from the original soundtrack will start playing once a new game is started, and stop once the user has won or lost the game. Sounds for flipping a card and matching it to another card were also incorporated.
